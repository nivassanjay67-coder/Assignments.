    <h1>About Nature</h1>
    <p>Nature is an inherent character or constitution,<sup>[1]</sup> particularly of the ecosphere or the universe as a whole. In this general sense nature refers to the laws, elements and phenomena of the physical world, including life. Although humans are part of nature, human activity or humans as a whole are often described as at times at odds, or outright separate and even superior to nature. <sup>[2]</sup></p>
